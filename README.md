# ssb-spec-drafts

A collection of protocol specifications for
[Secure Scuttlebutt](https://www.scuttlebutt.nz/), see the [drafts](drafts)
directory for an index.

## Note well

SSB-Drafts are working documents of the Secure Scuttlebutt community.
Note that other groups may also distribute working documents as SSB-Drafts.

SSB-Drafts are draft documents valid for a maximum of six months and
may be updated, replaced, or obsoleted by other documents at any
time.  It is inappropriate to use SSB-Drafts as reference material or
to cite them other than as "work in progress."

This wording aligns with the [IRTF](https://irtf.org)'s document
track for Internet-Drafts.
