1.  ssb-same-as

   A scuttlebot [1] plugin that provides a stream of which feeds are
   (and are not) the same as other feeds.

   The basis for creating the illusion of multi-feed identities in SSB!

   Based on ssb-friends [2] and graphreduce [3]

1.1.  TODO

   o  need to test merge blocking and unmerging

   o  hook into replication to ensure the correct feeds are replicated

   o  improve realtime performance (avoid re-traversing entire graph)

1.2.  Spec

1.2.1.  Assert that you are the same as another feed

   {
     type: 'contact',
     contact: TARGET_FEED_ID,
     following: true, // for backwards compat reasons
     sameAs: true
   }

1.2.2.  Block a sameAs

   {
     type: 'contact',
     contact: TARGET_FEED_ID,
     following: true, // for backwards compat reasons
     sameAs: false
   }

1.2.3.  Agree with another feed's assertion

SSB-Draft                        SAME-AS                       July 2019


   {
     type: 'contact',
     contact: TARGET_FEED_ID,
     following: true, // for backwards compat reasons
     sameAs: {
       SOURCE_FEED_ID: true // or `false` to remove an agreement
     }
   }

1.2.4.  Logic behind sameAs resolution

   o  If one side explicitly disagrees (with a "sameAs: false"), the
      identities will *NEVER be merged*.

   o  If both sides agree, the identity will *ALWAYS be merged*.

   o  If one side agrees (and the other side has not shared an opinion),
      and you agree, then the identities will be *merged*.

   o  In all other cases, the identities *will not be merged*.

   This module uses graphreduce to walk the "sameAs" links, so this
   means that any topology of links will be resolved.

1.3.  Exposed API (as sbot plugin)

1.3.1.  sbot.sameAs.stream({live: false, sync: true, old: true}) source

   Gets a list of all of the resolved and verified "sameAs" links
   between feeds.

   {from: 'a', to: 'b', value: true}
   {from: 'a', to: 'c', value: true}
   {from: 'a', to: 'd', value: true}
   {from: 'b', to: 'a', value: true}
   {from: 'b', to: 'c', value: true}
   {from: 'b', to: 'd', value: true}
   ...

1.3.2.  sbot.sameAs.get({id}, cb) async

   Gets a list of all of the verified "sameAs" links for a given feed.

   {
     'b': true,
     'c': true,
     'd': true
   }
