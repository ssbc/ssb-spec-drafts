   introductory section.

Status of This Memo

   SSB-Drafts are working documents of the Secure Scuttlebutt community.

   Drafts.

   SSB-Drafts are draft documents valid for a maximum of six months and
   may be updated, replaced, or obsoleted by other documents at any
   time.  It is inappropriate to use SSB-Drafts as reference material or
